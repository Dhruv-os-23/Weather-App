# Weather Website

This is a mini project for a static website that allows users to view weather information based on latitude and longitude coordinates. The website utilizes session storage to store the user's location details and fetches weather data from the OpenWeather API.

## Features

- Retrieve weather information based on user's current location.
- Search for weather information in any desired location.
- Display weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
- Retrieve data from the OpenWeather API using API calls.
- Parse the JSON response from the API to extract relevant weather information.
